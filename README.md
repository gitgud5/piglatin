# Convert Sentence/Words to Pig Latin and Back


	

## About Pig Lain :
Pig Latin is a secret language formed by the secret society of Pig to communicate between Pigs. After years of research we have found out how to decipher it. 

 - If an English word begins with a consonant you move that consonant at the end, and add "ay" to the end of the word. For Example :	 
    **1.** **Hello** becomes ***ellohay***
     **2.** **Cat** becomes ***atcay***
- If an English begins with a vowel and most commonly 'yay' is added to the end. But in different parts of the world, there are different 'dialects' of sorts. Some people may add 'way' or 'hay' or other endings
  **1.** **eat** becomes ***eatway***
  **2.** **egg** becomes ***eggway***
